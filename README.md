This is a `shiny` application that uses `plotly` to visualize treatment arms based on their bioluminescent flux values. The point of this is to have the `shiny` application hosted on a server.

The main issue is that my `.qmd` dashboard, built with the Quarto framework, fails to render when published on `connect.posit.cloud`, likely due to the embedded `shinylive`. The problem arises because the Plotly component of the line graph in my Shiny app requires a server, and I use `shinylive` to enable the Shiny app to run entirely in the clientâ€™s browser, but this is probably causing the error. To resolve this, I plan to replace the Plotly card in the dashboard with an `<iframe>` that points to a separate `.R` script hosted on a Shiny server (e.g., `shinyapps.io`). This hosted Shiny app will handle the Plotly visualization, allowing users to upload the `processed_data.csv` file directly within that environment. This ended up working but the .qmd dashboard doesn't render as a neat and orderly dashboard any more. Instead, it renders as disorganized jarbled plain text. I think there's an issue with the .html output that's happening due to the IVIS images loop.

## How it works:
The user uploads a .csv file of processed_data.csv.
